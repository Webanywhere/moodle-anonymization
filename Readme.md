Moodle User Anonymizer
======================

Set your database connection details on line 25 and run with 'ruby moodle.rb'

You can optionally set a password for all users, or uncomment out the line which sets random passwords.  Note that this randomises passwords for all users, including the admin account.

User data is now somewhat anonymised, but we hold no liability for how safe or secure this might be.

ToDo
====

It would be really nice if we used Faker to make some of the values more believable.
